CRAPDEMO!

Another little amusement by Tursi. Inspired by the last couple of things
I've downloaded by people who have already proven they can do better. ;)

Be patient with it, actually, and a few things kick in after a while.
I suppose some of the files give it away. How the hell do you combine
things in PsyQ into a single executable file? Damn, I should probably
actually learn the header structure or something...

But, because my goal was one evening, and the extras is pushing that,
I'll release it as separate files. Oh, I know, I'll rename them. ;)
There, just run 'start.bat' if you're on Caetla, have PSEXE in your path,
and so on. Otherwise, I'm sure you can figure it out. I included an 'auto'
file, dunno if it'll work. ;)

Okay, added switch from NTSC to PAL.
R1 - PAL
L1 - NTSC

Still boots in NTSC. :)
