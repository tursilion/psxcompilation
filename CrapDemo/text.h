Hi there and welcome to CrapDemo, by Tursi! I was sitting there, downloading \
the latest 'awesome' demos, and it occurred to me, I've never done a demo! \
I've always tried to do interactive and amusing software. So here you go! \
the latest tres kewl static picture and flat crawl-text DEMO!!!!!!!<many \
more exclamation points to show how kewl I am>!!!!!!!!!!!!  N-E-way \
(note clever use of letters instead of spelling the words, ooooooh), are \
you impressed yet? I know some people who don't get this bor.. er.. kewl, \
until their FOURTH release! And this is only my first! Whoooo! hey, guess \
what happens next? No, go on, guess. That's right! More flat scroll text! \
Heeee! Like the MOD? It's total crap, too! But at least it's funny crap. \
Speaking of crap, Street Fighter 3. I know, it's old news. But it's \
diahearra (I can't spell and I won't look it up). It's crap, but it's \
very SMOOOTH crap. Ick. Oh, hell, you watched this long, I'll thrill you. \
*Wheeeeeeee.... see? It did something. Patience is rewarded, young \
Skywalker. Technical and possibly interesting tidbits - my first release \
using PsyQ, which means I can finally use Silpheed's MOD player. Yes, I'm \
a Yaroze weenie. ;) This font is Comic from Win95. The picture is the logo \
for Moving Target Software Designs, my so called company. Total staff is \
me. Well, technically two, cause I have an artist, and very technically \
three if I include the guy who started it. Heh. A few pixel glitches on the \
font and the picture. Know what? Don't care. ;) *Wheeeeeee! \
Current Playstation \
project is Captain Communism. Character by Vidi Epson, art by Foxxfire, \
code and probably level design by me. Looking not too shabby for a Yaroze \
project, if I say so myself. (And I did.) Demo is on my web site under \
the betas section, hit http://neteng.bc.ca/~tursi, jump into games, and hit \
betas at the bottom. The current version should be up by the time this is. \
Playable, but no enemies yet, and only one level map. Patience. *Wheee! \
See? Rewarded your patience again. Oh, one more effect. &You'll see it soon. \
Well, I'll call an end to this scroller, \
then. I'll do the traditional greets, even though I'm just a weenie and \
don't actually know any of you, email exchanges are welcome. ;) tursi@\
neteng.bc.ca - Oh, hell, let's do something different for the greets, \
something never done before! %That's right! a CO-SIN scroller! Whooo!!! \
Greets out to: Silpheed \
for the MOD player that is apparently a standard in the PSX scene... nice \
job. Loser for the comments on his page towards me, thanks, dude. Napalm \
and Hitmen for posting my crap on their websites, thanks for the exposure. \
Personal greets to Foxxfire for being special, Gord and Vombatus \
for the Moving Target logo (whoever is actually responsible in the end.. ;) ),  \
Rimplestiltstalker, cause I'll make him read this, and then I'll throw in \
some names who prolly won't see this, like Orzel, Lyon, and Rafeki. \
And really I don't think I know too many other names, so thanks if you've \
linked to my stuff, or even liked it. If you talked to me once in a while \
I'd remember your name and greet you. Oooooh. ;) *Whe..!oof! Ok, ok, \
I'll stop being so excited. Ciao, Durhed.                                   "};
