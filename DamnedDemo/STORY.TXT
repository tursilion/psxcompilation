"                 So, heres a new Tursi Demo for you all to Boo at!
 :)
 Here we see a nice typical Canadian snowstorm. Roaring snow brought to
 you from sunny Virginia. Imma displaced Canajan, what can I say, eh?
 Isnt it fun?
  NEWay, this demo came to be after daily messages from Rocko, who wanted
 a demo for his WPW group. At first, I was blown away flattered, but, as
 time went on, it proved to be a bit of a pain in the ass.
[4 Sooooo.... [8 I got to work. I havent got anything now for about a month, 
 so I put this together over the last week. The idea in my head 
 was to try out some retro effects.
 Rocko doesnt like it, but I say too bad. hehehe...
[5 So, here we have a nice scrolltext, lightning, color cycling, 3d snow
 field, demo ballz, [3 and then one more little effect.. oh yeah, its
 your classic fire. Fire! Fire! HEH HEH HEH HEH. Oh joy.
 The MOD playing is the title theme from Anarchy, an old game.
 The Tursi logo is a drawing by Foxxfire
 done for me for one of the conventions I went to. Its coooool. Yay!
 The WPW logo is from WPW, of course.
 Im not big on the PSX anymore.. I sorta got my
 console kicks already. Still, this was fun, if freaking annoying many times.
 Im still not happy with some effects, or the speed of the machine.
[6 But, its still cool. [7 Id like to understand how to translate a point
 with the GTE, though. The starfield is using lookup tables and rotation
 math in the CPU. [4 Actually, [8 the balls use a nice inverse tangent lookup
 table, too. I never did anything with TAN before. Yay, trig! Couple of
 greets to Rocko for bugging me about this and then not liking it anyway,
 Loser cause hes cool and doing great work with his page and utils. Van
 Helsing if hes still about for the BIN2INC tool Im still using. [5 DDB, Napalm
 and Hitmen for making it possible for me to subject you to this. [3 Heheh.
 Visit my page! Cause I said so.
 And now, maybe Rocko wants to say some things...
