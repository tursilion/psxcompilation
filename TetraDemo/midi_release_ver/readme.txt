Tetr-A-Demo by Tursi
--------------------

First PSX release... basic Tetris clone with a few fancy graphics,
just seeing what I can do with the PSX.

        Standard buttons to rotate (X,O, square, triangle)
        L1 - Start on level 5
        L2 - Start on level 10
        R2 - Start on Level 15 >:)
        R1 - Hold to change music
        Select - Dim scrolltext
        Start - Pause
