Just a compilation of my Playstation one demos:

Captain Communism - unfinished game demo, no enemies. NOTE: This is from '98 or so. It does NOT indicate support for the current crap going on. Fuck war.\
Crap Demo - a crap little demo for fun\
Damned Demo - a fun demo made for a German group\
Sand - a little particle slideshow demo\
Takatron - a port of my DOS Takatron game to PSX\
Tetr-a-Demo - a graphical Tetris game/demo

There used to be an adult Tetris on the disc, I've disabled that and it can't be re-enabled, though you'll still see it on the menu. ;)
