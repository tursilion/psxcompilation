Just a compilation of my Playstation one demos:

Captain Communism - unfinished game demo, no enemies
Crap Demo - a crap little demo for fun
Damned Demo - a fun demo made for a German group
Sand - a little particle slideshow demo
Takatron - a port of my DOS Takatron game to PSX
Tetr-a-Demo - a graphical Tetris game/demo

There used to be an adult Tetris on the disc, I've disabled that and it can't be re-enabled, though you'll still see it on the menu. ;)
