SAND
by Tursi
using Silpheed's MOD player, a cool mod by someone I don't know, and art
mostly by people I don't know, but horribly mangled by me, maybe beyond
recognition. ;)

This is a PSX binary for Caetla. Enjoy!

Prolly last release. Mind you, That was supposed to be Captain C, but I
hadda drop that project. yay!
