the sand demo! Another unexpected POC from Tursi! I only wanted to throw together a few effects and play with particles. My conclusion? The PSX is too slow to do what I want. yeah, yeah, I hear you ASM coders screaming. Relax. Heh.
So anyway, This demo bounces a thousand two-pixel lines around at plus or minus sixty fps. The pictures are varied stuff from my hard drive - see how many you recognize. Mostly old stuff. Hey, Im an old-timer. heh.
Im not doing any more PSX stuff... I didnt expect to do this one. Maybe a little bit once in a while - mostly Im disappointed because the PSXDEV list is so damn quiet.
You people all go get lives or what? Oh yes, font is the one from my Tetrademo, which was a font off an old Amiga CD I have. The mod is DSS-Demo, from the Digital Sound Studio on the Amiga - I actually bought that package!
GFX from all over - and they might be hard to make out if you dont know them, so sorry!
The graphics format kept changing on me, as did the demo... put this together over four evenings.
Anyway, greets to hmm.. lessee.. a few people wrote back after I released CrapDemo, but its been so long now. Heh.. well Van Helsing gets one, Cat! if hes still around, Loser - did you do anything with those srcs?
... and... Silpheed for his MOD player... err...oh hell, you guys never greet me. !GRIN!
I better greet the people I actually KNOW, eh? Hihi to Foxxfire, Rimplestiltstalker, Binky, Flipper, Vombatus, Vidi, ah, thats enough.
Tursi signing off... see www.neteng.bc.ca/~tursi in lowercase for non-PSX stuff... we wrap...
